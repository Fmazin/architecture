## The project

Opening Reproducible Research (o2r) is a DFG-funded research project by Institute for Geoinformatics ([ifgi](http://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/)) and University and Regional Library ([ULB](http://www.ulb.uni-muenster.de/)), University of MÃ¼nster, Germany. Building on recent advances in mainstream IT, o2r envisions a new architecture for storing, executing and interacting with the original analysis environment alongside the corresponding research data and manuscript. This architecture evolves around so called _Executable Research Compendia_ (ERC) as the container for both research, review, and archival.

## Guidelines

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Build

This specification is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), rendered with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) using a few [Python Markdown extensions](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html), and deployed automatically using Travis CI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/o2r-project/architecture.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/o2r-project/architecture)

Use `mkdocs` to render it locally.

```bash
# pip install mkdocs mkdocs-cinder
mkdocs serve
```

### Automated Builds

Our combination of the `.travis.yml` and `.deploy.sh` will run the `mkdocs` command on every direct commit or merge on the master branch and deploy the rendered HTML documents to the `gh-pages` branch in this repository.

Travis authenticates its push to the `gh-pages` branch using a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) of the user [@o2r-user](https://github.com/o2r-user), who has write access to this repository.
The access token is encrypted in the `.travis.yml` [using Travis CLI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/) and is specific to this repository.

```bash
travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=<token here>
```

The variable `GH_TOKEN` is used in the deploy script.
The token generated on the GitHub website should not be stored anywhere, simply generate a new one if needed.

This has some security risks, as described [here](https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd#sign-up-for-travis-and-add-your-project).
To mitigate these risks, the option "Build pull requests" on the [Travis configuration page for this repo](https://travis-ci.org/o2r-project/erc-spec/settings) must be disabled so malicious changes to the Travis configuration file will not be build before maintainer inspection.

## Diagrams

The diagrams are created with [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).
All source files (`.graphml`) are stored in `/docs/img`.
The PNG renderings are exported from yEd with `transparent` background, a margin of `5`, and a scaling factor of `1.0`.
