> Opening Reproducible Research (o2r) is a DFG-funded research project by Institute for Geoinformatics ([ifgi](http://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/)) and University and Regional Library ([ULB](https://www.ulb.uni-muenster.de/)), University of MÃ¼nster, Germany. Building on recent advances in mainstream IT, o2r envisions a new architecture for storing, executing and interacting with the original analysis environment alongside the corresponding research data and manuscript. This architecture evolves around so called Executable Research Compendia (ERC) as the container for both research, review, and archival.
